During my first year at CSULB, I studied music education and performance at the Bob Cole Conservatory of Music. After learning that the music ed lifestyle was not for me, I turned to my life-long interest in the natural sciences. My dad’s planted freshwater aquaria were my first introductions into ecology and biology. Trips to the high Mojave with family friends opened my eyes to paleontology and geology. Gardening with my mom exposed me to botany. As I moved away from music, I chose to pursue my oldest fascination, biology.\r\nWhile working towards my BS in organismal biology, I had the privileged opportunity to work as a research assistant in Dr. Bruno Pernet’s marine larval biology lab. This first experience with academia scratched an itch, and I found the problem solving process of experimental design and data analysis addicting. Read more about the work I did in the Pernet Lab on my Research page.\r\nThe summer before starting graduate school, I completed two distinct internships in wetland conservation. One focused on large-scale restoration projects, where I also led educational tours for visitors ranging from kindergarteners to college students and beyond. The other provided a glimpse into ecological consulting, involving efforts to conserve rare native plants and conduct biotic and abiotic site monitoring.\r\nAt Cal State Northridge, I’ve enjoyed exploring experimental evolutionary ecology, stumbling my way though developing a methodology for working with rotifers endemic to the Purple Pitcher Plant leaf water community.

Diversity Experiment\r\nStock Cultures\r\nI’ve started 33 new stock cultures using the rotifers I isolated in October. I also refreshed the existing stock cultures (50% water change, new sterile wheat seed, new foam stopper). I’ll hold onto the original stock cultures until I’m sure the refreshed ones are healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber of clones\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSite\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaf\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent\r\n\r\n\r\nProjected\r\n\r\n\r\nCrystal\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nPleaphase\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this second round of isolations, I’m still not reaching the goal of 5 clones per leaf. This week I’m deciding whether I should isolate a 3rd time.\r\nRotifer Traits\r\ni. Population growth rate\r\nDirect census of population on the first and last day of the experiment. Population growth calculated as (ln Nt − ln N0) / t .\r\nii. Embryonic development time (EDT)\r\nGravid rotifers haphazardly selected from each clone will be placed in 96-well plates with a small volume of media. Each well will be seeded with bacteria from the same source culture. Wells will be covered with microscope cover slips to minimize evaporation. 24-48 hours of time-lapse imaging every 30 minutes will be scored for egg laying and hatching.\r\n(Specifics of imaging still need to be worked out… currently only have the capability to observe 9 wells at a time.)\r\niii. Rotifer size and egg size\r\nAt the end of the experiment, each well will be fixed using Lugol’s iodine solution and imaged at a high resolution. The image of each well will then be passed through an automated pipeline in ImageJ that (1) makes the image binary, (2) identifies, crops, and saves individual “particles”, and (3) generates particle morphometrics. Each image will then need to be manually categorized as rotifer or egg.\r\niv. Respiration rate\r\nRate of oxygen consumption will be measured over the course of 6 hours at ambient and stressful temperature. The number of individuals from each clone needed to get a clear signal from the respiration plate still requires some testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
